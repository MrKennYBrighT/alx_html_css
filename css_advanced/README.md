# HTML Advanced Concept Page

This project focuses on building an advanced HTML page based on a design provided in Figma. The primary objective is to implement the HTML structure, ensuring all content and elements are correctly placed. Styling (CSS) is the next phase of this project, but for this part, the focus is purely on the HTML foundation.

## Project Objectives

* Create an index.html file with the provided HTML structure.
* Ensure all images, text content, and interactive elements (like links and buttons) are correctly incorporated.
* Make any necessary adjustments to the HTML to enhance structure or include placeholder elements (e.g., for logos if specific image paths aren't provided initially).

## Important Notes:

* *Figma Design:* The design file is available on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Fk9zS4T2F3Z3F4z3F4z3F4/Headphone-company?node-id=0%3A1). You can duplicate it to your drafts to access all design details.
* *Fonts:* If your computer doesn't have the fonts used in the design, you can find them here:
    * [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)
    * [Spin-Cycle-OT](https://www.fonts.com/font/itc/spin-cycle-ot/regular) (Note: This font might require a license or a free alternative if not publicly available).
* *Float Values:* Some values in the design might be in float. Feel free to round them for practical implementation in CSS.
* *Images:* A set of images for this project can be downloaded [here](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rlabs_html_css_advanced_concept/images.zip). Remember to place them in an images folder relative to your index.html file, as the provided HTML uses relative paths like ./images/.
* *Placeholder Logos:* The provided HTML uses placeholder images for logos (https://fakeimg.pl/250x250?text=Sample+Logo). You should replace these with actual logo image paths once they are available or create a placeholder image locally.

## Getting Started

1.  *Clone the repository* (if applicable) or create a new project directory.
2.  *Create an index.html file* in the root of your project.
3.  *Copy the provided HTML code* into your index.html file.
4.  *Download the images* for the project and place them in an images folder.
5.  *Open index.html in your browser* to view the raw HTML structure.
6.  *Proceed to apply CSS* in the next phase of the project to style the page according to the Figma design.
