## Project Structure

The `css_basic` folder is structured as follows:

css_basic/

├── index.html          # Main HTML file linking to CSS

├── styles.css          # Primary CSS file for styling index.html

├── base.css            # Contains common default CSS rules to enhance base styling.

└── README.md           # This documentation file

### Instructions
To ensure your HTML files render with styles:

Make sure that both the base.css and styles.css are in the same directory as your HTML files.
Ensure the following lines are added to the <head> tag of both HTML files:
<link href="base.css" rel="stylesheet">
<link href="styles.css" rel="stylesheet">
